🔹 AI Model Task Prompt:
"Develop an AI-powered adaptive learning system that can:

Extract key concepts from study materials (PDF, text, etc.) using NLP.

Automatically generate MCQ-based assessments with four answer choices.

Evaluate user responses and identify incorrect answers.

Re-generate new MCQs for incorrectly answered concepts until mastery is achieved.

Track student progress and dynamically adjust future assessments based on past performance.

The AI should be able to:

Perform document analysis (PDF text extraction, topic identification).

Generate multiple-choice questions dynamically using NLP models.

Evaluate student answers and classify them as correct or incorrect.

Provide instant feedback on incorrect answers and regenerate new MCQs for weak concepts.

Maintain a progress tracking system that adapts question difficulty based on past performance.

🔹 Technical Constraints & Requirements:
NLP Libraries: Use SpaCy, Hugging Face, or OpenAI API for text extraction & concept identification.

MCQ Generation Model: Utilize transformers, T5, or GPT-based models for question creation.

Answer Evaluation: Implement a marking algorithm to assess user responses.

Reattempt Mechanism: Regenerate new MCQs for wrongly answered concepts using reinforcement learning.

User Tracking: Maintain a student performance database to personalize learning.

The system should function in a fully automated manner, ensuring that students focus only on mastering concepts efficiently."

🔹 Next Steps: Model Development Plan 🏗️
Since you want a working prototype, I suggest building it step-by-step:

✅ Step 1: PDF Scanning & Concept Extraction

Convert PDFs to text (use PyMuPDF or pdfplumber).

Extract key concepts using NLP (SpaCy, NLTK, BERT).

✅ Step 2: MCQ Generation

Use T5/GPT-based models to create question-answer pairs.

Implement distractor generation for MCQ options.

✅ Step 3: Answer Marking & Evaluation

Store correct answers in a database.

Compare user responses and mark incorrect ones.

✅ Step 4: Regeneration of MCQs for Incorrect Answers

AI identifies weak concepts and creates new MCQs.

Loop continues until the student answers correctly.

✅ Step 5: Progress Tracking & Personalization

Store learning history in a database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB).

Adjust difficulty levels dynamically.
